# SpamLord

Some people who give out their contacts on the internet will intentionally obfuscate their email addresses and phone numbers in order to deter bots and spammers from automatically getting said info. 

For example, the email manning@cs.stanford.edu can become
> manning(at)cs.stanford.edu

> manning at cs dot stanford dot edu

> manning [at] cs stanford edu 

While the phone number 650-723-0293 can become

> (650) 723-0293

> 650 723 0293

et cetera.

SpamLord is an exercise using Regular Expression to catch, identify, and extract the correct form of the obfuscated info.
